To use a custom asset, currently:
    - choose an unused objectId to be repurposed for the custom item
    - in Actor_Init, edit the unused entry in the gObjectTable to be a copy of another object (which will be the base for the modifications)
    - in CustomModels_EditItemCMB, add a case for the objectId and make a function to edit the CMB model inside the ZAR object file
    - if you need to apply a custom texture to the model:
        - add a CMAB file with the new texture in the custom archive (romfs/zelda_gi_melody.zar)
        - in CustomModels_ApplyItemCMAB, add a case for the objectId
    - add the objectId to this txt file
